# Video Quality Metrics

Video quality metrics, reference implementation in python, with GPU optimizations and C versions as time permits.

- VIF (sometimes called VIF-P or VIFP), Visual Information Fidelity: implemented
- SSIM, Structural Similarity Metric: implemented
- PSNR, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio: implemented
- RECO, Relative Polar Edge Coherence: implemented
- NIQE, Natural Image Quality Evaluator: implemented
- MS-SSIM, MultiScale Structural Similarity Metric: planned
- 3SSIM, 3-Component Structural Similarity Metric: planned
- VQUAD-HD: planned
- VQM: maybe
- UIQ, Universal Image Quality: maybe
- MSSIM, Motion SSIM: maybe

## Motivations:
- This is forked to provide a more suitable structure for a project (e.g. to import using pip).

## Example

Run the demo/jpg_demo.py script, which will compress lena.png with JPEG at every quality setting 0-100, and plot all metric values vs quality setting and vs file size.
